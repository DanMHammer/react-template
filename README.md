Based on frontend-masters-react-v5 https://frontendmasters.com/courses/complete-react-v5/

I created this repository as a simple template/example for starting projects following similar design principles from the Frontend Masters React v5 video series. Made to be used with VSCode. The purpose of creating this was to go over the important parts of the video series and give myself a means to easily practice those concepts with small projects without going through the setup again. I may apply this template to future projects or create a better template from it later.

npm install
npm run dev

That should install parcel and all dependencies. Make sure the eslint and prettier VSCode extensions are installed. Restart VSCode for the eslint configuration to take effect.
